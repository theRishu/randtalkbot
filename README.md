Telegram bot matching you with a random person of desired sex speaking on your language(s). Chat with anonymous strangers [here](https://t.me/RandTalkBot). Rand Talk was written on Python 3.6 and [telepot](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot) and uses MariaDB to store users' preferences. Rand Talk's interface was translated on several languages. You're able to send any messages except replies and forwarded messages. Rand Talk rewards you with bonuses for people you invite using your individual link. To get this link, use @RandTalkBot as inline bot. The bot collects stats regularly. Rand Talk rewards you with more bonuses for the people of rare sex.

## Supported commands

In @BotFather compatible format:

```
begin - Begin looking for next stranger

```

## Roadmap

1. Reports

## Deployment

We're using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to deploy [Rand Talk's Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/quasiyoke/randtalkbot/).

Create `configuration/db_root_password` and `configuration/db_password` files containing database passwords and `configuration/telegram_token` containing Telegram bot's token. After that write `configuration/configuration.json` file like that:

```json
{
    "admins": [31416, 271828],
    "database": {
        "host": "db",
        "name": "randtalkbot",
        "user": "randtalkbot",
    },
    "logging": {
        "version": 1,
        "formatters": {
            "simple": {
                "class": "logging.Formatter",
                "format": "%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(message)s"
            }
        },
        "handlers": {
            "console": {
                "class": "logging.StreamHandler",
                "level": "DEBUG",
                "formatter": "simple"
            }
        },
        "loggers": {
            "randtalkbot": {
                "level": "DEBUG",
                "handlers": []
            },
            "peewee": {
                "level": "DEBUG",
                "handlers": []
            }
        },
        "root": {
            "level": "DEBUG",
            "handlers": ["console", "email"]
        }
    }
}
```

Where:

- `admins` — list of admins' Telegram IDs. Admins are able to use extended list of bot commands. Optional. Default is `[]`.
- `logging` — logging setup as described in [this howto](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html).

Fetch Docker Compose file:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quasiyoke/RandTalkBot/master/docker-compose.yml
```

Now you may run Rand Talk:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Building gettext files

Use [verboselib](https://github.com/oblalex/verboselib) to extract new messages:

```sh
verboselib-manage.py extract -d randtalkbot -a -o randtalkbot/locale -i lib
```

And to compile them:

```sh
verboselib-manage.py compile -d randtalkbot/locale
```

### Deployment

To comfortably inject source code changes to the Docker container use another Docker Compose file:

```sh
docker-compose --file docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

### Tests

Launch tests and observe code coverage:

```sh
coverage run --source=randtalkbot -m unittest
coverage report -m
```

Launch some specific test:

```sh
python -m unittest tests.test_stranger.TestStranger
```

### Codestyle

Please notice that tests' source code is also covered with codestyle checks but requirements for it are softer:

```sh
python setup.py lint
```
# randtalkbot
# randtalkbot
# randtalkbot
# randtalkbot
